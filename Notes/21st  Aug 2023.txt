Poly

Polymorphism  feature of Object-Oriented Programming.
polymorphism means having many forms
  
mainly divided into two types: 
	1) Compile-time Polymorphism /static polymorphism = function overloading.   cmd > javac 
	2) Runtime Polymorphism			cmd > java 



Method Overloading
 a) When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters then these functions     are said to be overloaded. 
		class Arithmetic {
				void add() { }  
				void add(int a) { }  
				int  add(int a , float b) { }  
			}


Runtime Polymorphism / Dynamic Method Dispatch /

a) Method overriding, occurs when a derived class (extends) has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.



1) Association is a relation between two separate classes
2) Association can be 
	a) one-to-one, 
	b) one-to-many, 
		many  == [ ]array 
	c) many-to-one, 
	d) many-to-many

3) Aggregation are the two forms of association.
