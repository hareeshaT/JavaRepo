Exception  
     problem  --> how to solve 


java.lang.Throwable 
java.lang.Exception extends  java.lang.Throwable  --> event driven --> handle program
java.lang.Error     extends  java.lang.Throwable			can not / should not handle 

java.lang.Exception
1) Checked Exception  --> developer has to check 
2) un checked Exception --> JVM 

java.lang.Exception  == handle 

1) try{ 
	// code which has possibility of exception 
    }
    catch(which _exception_to be caught) {

	// solution 
    }

2) try{ 
	// code which has possibility of exception 
    }
    catch(which _exception_to be caught || which _exception_to be caught) {

	// solution 
    }
    
3) try{ 
	// code which has possibility of exception 
    }
    catch(which _exception_to be caught) {

	// solution 
    }
    finally{
        // logic would be executed where there is an exception or not 
	}

or
3) try{ 
	// code which has possibility of exception 
    }
    finally{
        // logic would be executed where there is an exception or not 
	}

4) throw  --> raise an exception  

5 throws 

Why 
	home - puncture -catch(solution)==> traffic n Office  --> application should not exit due to exception 

certain .class  predefined unchecked exption
			ArithmeticException
			NullpointerException   

Custom exception  == user defined exception 


class <className> extends Exception 


Tomorrow  --> collection --> interface
